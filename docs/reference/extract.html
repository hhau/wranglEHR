<title>Extract &amp; Reshape Data from EMAP

This is the workhorse function that transcribes data from EMAP OPS from OMOP 
CDM 5.3.1 to a standard rectangular table with 1 column per dataitem and 1
row per time per patient.

The time unit is user definable, and set by the "cadance" argument. The
default behaviour is to produce a table with 1 row per hour per patient. If
there are duplicates/conflicts (e.g more than 1 event for a given hour), then
the default behaviour is that only the first result for that hour is
returned. One can override this behvaiour by supplying a vector of summary
functions directly to the 'coalesce_rows' argument. This could also include
any custom function written by the end user, so long as it takes a vector of
length n, and returns a vector of length 1, of the original data type.

Many events inside EMAP occur on a greater than hourly basis. Depending
upon the chosen analysis, you may which to increase the cadance. 0.5 for
example will produce a table with 1 row per 30 minutes per patient. Counter
to this, 24 would produce 1 row per 24 hours.

Choose what variables you want to pull out wisely. This function is quite
efficient considering what it needs to do, but it can take a very long
time if extracting lots of data, and doing so repeatedly. It is a strong 
recomendation that you run your extraction on a small subset of patients
first and check that you are happy with the result, before moving to a larger
extraction.

The current implementation is focussed on in-patients only. And as such, all
dataitems are referenced to the visit_start_datetime of the visit_occurrence.
Thus, observations and measurements recorded outside the boudaries of the
visit_occurrence are automatically removed. This is - at this stage -
intensional behaviour. — extract • wranglEHR</title>
