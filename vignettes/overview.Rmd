wranglEHR is a data extraction tool for EMAP. It is a fork of the inspectEHR package for CC-HIC. The goal of this package is to provide a core set of functions to easily and reliably extract data from an OMOP CDM version 5.3.1, and to arrange it in a format that would be expected by statistical software. This is primarily for ease of use, but also has advantages in making a common part of the analytical pipeline reproducible for a large number of people.
